# Invoice Processing UI #
==============

Invoice Processing UI is a combination of HTML, CSS, jQuery, JS and a very nice PDF viewer.
The pdf viewer is done by the project PDF.JS (by Mozilla). 
PDF.js is a Portable Document Format (PDF) viewer that is built with HTML5. 
The library is available from https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js

The right side is populated by extracted data which is loaded from a JSON file. The features included are:
